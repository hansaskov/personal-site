      Robotics have tought me the importance of good collaboration, and to have
      a proactive and solution-focused mindset. As it is necessary to manage
      unexpected situations that often arise in large-scale projects. For
      instance, I successfully programmed a UR5 robot to detect, grasp and throw
      objects with collision detection.
